# Analysis-of-Belt-Road-Trade-Effect
The“Belt and Road”is aimed to connect regions or countries,build a trading community and promote the free and inclusive development of the global economy.Based on the flow network model,this paper compares the global trade network with the“Belt and Road”trade network from two perspectives:community structure and core-edge structure,and describes the relationship between the economic structures of China and the United States and two networks’differences by correlation analysis.The study found that:1)the structures of the two trade networks are relatively stable.Compared with the global trade network,the“Belt and Road”trade network has regional discontinuities in the distribution of communities and reflects the strategic deployment of the“Belt and Road”;2)the ranking of node’s coreness has the characteristics of power law distribution,but the core-edge structures of the two networks develop differently;3)the trade strengths,corenesses,and economic strengths of China and the United States are all positively related to the trade network’s integrity,but the correlation between the trade intensity of the countries with different development levels and the core-edge structure is different.
